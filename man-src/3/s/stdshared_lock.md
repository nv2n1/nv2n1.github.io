std::shared_lock - std::shared_lock

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<pre><code>Defined in header &lt;shared_mutex&gt;

template&lt; class Mutex &gt;           (since C++14)

class shared_lock;</code></pre> 
The class shared_lock is a general-purpose shared mutex ownership wrapper allowing deferred locking, timed locking and transfer of lock ownership. Locking a shared_lock locks the associated shared mutex in shared mode (to lock it in exclusive mode, std::unique_lock can be used) 
The shared_lock class is movable, but not copyable -- it meets the requirements of MoveConstructible and MoveAssignable but not of CopyConstructible or CopyAssignable. 
In order to wait in a shared mutex in shared ownership mode, std::condition_variable_any can be used (std::condition_variable requires std::unique_lock and so can only wait in unique ownership mode) 

<h2>Template parameters</h2>

Mutex - the type of the shared mutex to lock. The type must meet the SharedMutex requirements
