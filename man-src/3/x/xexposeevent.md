<p>XExposeEvent &#8211; Expose event structure </p>
<h2>Structures</h2>
<p>The structure for <code>Expose</code> events contains: </p>
<p> typedef struct {<br />
&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;int type;&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;/*&nbsp;Expose&nbsp;*/<br />
&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;unsigned long serial;&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;/*&nbsp;#&nbsp;of last request processed by server&nbsp;*/<br />
&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;Bool send_event;&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;/*&nbsp;true if this came from a SendEvent request&nbsp;*/<br />
&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;Display&nbsp;*display;&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;/*&nbsp;Display the event was read from&nbsp;*/<br />
&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;Window window;<br />
&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;int x, y;<br />
&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;int width, height;<br />
&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;int count;&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;/*&nbsp;if nonzero, at least this many more&nbsp;*/ } XExposeEvent; </p>
<p> When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows. </p>
<p> The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a <code>GraphicsExpose</code> event to a client application, it sends an <code>XGraphicsExposeEvent</code> structure with the type member set to <code>GraphicsExpose</code>. The display member is set to a pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event member is set to <code>True</code> if the event came from a <code>SendEvent</code> protocol request. The serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers. </p>
<p> The window member is set to the exposed (damaged) window. The x and y members are set to the coordinates relative to the window&#8217;s origin and indicate the upper-left corner of the rectangle. The width and height members are set to the size (extent) of the rectangle. The count member is set to the number of <code>Expose</code> events that are to follow. If count is zero, no more <code>Expose</code> events follow for this window. However, if count is nonzero, at least that number of <code>Expose</code> events (and possibly more) follow for this window. Simple applications that do not want to optimize redisplay by distinguishing between subareas of its window can just ignore all <code>Expose</code> events with nonzero counts and perform full redisplays on events with zero counts.</p>
