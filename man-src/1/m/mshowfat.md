<h2>Name</h2>
<p> mshowfat &#8211; shows FAT clusters allocated to file </p>
<h2>Note of warning</h2>
<p> This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&#8217;s texinfo documentation, and may not be entirely accurate or complete. See the end of this man page for details. </p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p> The <tt>mshowfat</tt> command is used to display the FAT entries for a file. Syntax: </p>
<p> <i> </i></p>
<pre>
<tt>mshowfat</tt> [<tt>-o</tt> <i>offset</i>] <i>files</i>
</pre>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> If no offset is given, a list of all clusters occupied by the file is printed. If an offset is given, only the number of the cluster containing that offset is printed. </p>

<h2>Viewing the texi doc</h2>
<p> This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools&#8217;s texinfo documentation. However, this process is only approximative, and some items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this translation process. Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in the manpage format. Moreover, not all information has been translated into the manpage version. Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc. See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the texinfo doc.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html. Indeed, in the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in info. </p>
